# Development Log

## 2026-05-11

- Started Phase 2 Reports Plus discovery and cataloging.
- Added reusable Reports Plus report and dataset inventory methods.
- Added CLI inventory commands with JSON output, summary output, and local JSON catalog persistence.
- Added lightweight Flask pages for report inventory, report detail inspection, and dataset inventory.
- Added initial report content clue extraction for dataset references, chart definitions, metrics references, and query structures while preserving raw content.
- Separated API collection mapping from the health evaluation matrix.
- Created `API_MAPPING.md` as the source-centric capability catalog.
- Refocused `HEALTHCHECK_MATRIX.md` on health questions, required data, rules, severity, and reporting status.
- Rationale: one source can support many health checks, and health logic should not be embedded in API inventory.
- Initialized standalone `cv-healthcheck` project.
- Added reusable Commvault API client.
- Added Reports Plus metadata and dataset query helpers.
- Added CLI and lightweight Flask exploration UI.
